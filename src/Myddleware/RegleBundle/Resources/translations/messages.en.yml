                On this page, you will find general information on your rule. Here you can enable automatic synchronisation of your rule by setting the activation button on ON.  
                If your rule is activated, a task will run your rule every 5 minutes. However you can perform your rule manually by clicking on " Run the rule" even if the automatic synchronisation is not enabled.
                To change more parameters in your rule, go to the tab "parameter" on this page.
        mapping: >
                On this page you will find all the fields of your source and target applications used in your rule. You will also find the formulas for data transformation. 
                If you need help to create your formulas, go to our blog  at the following adress : <a href="http://community.myddleware.com/index.php/developer-guide/#create-formula" target="_blank">See the page on formulas</a>.        
        relate: >
                Here you will find all the relations to link data in your applications More information on relations at the following adress: <a href="http://community.myddleware.com/index.php/tutorial/#relationships" target="_blank">see the page on relations</a>
        param: >
                The reference date shows which data will be read in your source system. Only data that were created or modified after that date will be read and sent to the target system.
                Therefore if you want to migrate your old data, you need to take a date in the past. If you only want to transfer the new data, then leave the day's date.
                The number of days for deleting data indicates the number of days your data has been stored in Myddleware. Eventhough your data is encrypted in Myddleware, we do not allow a backup of more than 60 days. You can reduce this number of days, but keep in mind that we can not provide assistance on deleted data.
    rule:
        fields: >
                Here you can select the correspondance between the fields of your 2 modules simply by a drag and drop. 
                For example, you can choose to put the name of a Sugar contact in the name of a Salesforce account, 
                for that, just drag the field "name" of your source module and drop it in the field "name" of your target solution. 
                To delete a field that was already placed, just double click on it. 
                You can also use formulas to transform your data. If you need assistance to create formulas, go to our blog at the following adress: <a href="http://community.myddleware.com/index.php/developer-guide/#create-formula" target="_blank">See the page on formulas</a>.  
                For more information or personalised assistance, feel free to contact us.
        simulate: >
                Here you can simulate the result of the rules you have implemented in the previous stage. 
                Click on the "test data" button, Myddleware will read a data of your source application to show you how it will be sent to your target application. 
        relate: >
                This tab allows you to define the relations you want to implement in your interface. That way you can link several rules together. 
                For example, it is possible to transfer the relation between a contact and an account so that they will also be linked in the target solution.
                More information on relations at the following adress: <a href="http://community.myddleware.com/index.php/tutorial/#relationships" target="_blank">see the page on relations</a>
        filter: >
                This tab allows you to filter the fields of your source application at play
                For example, you can choose to take all the contacts whose country is "France".
                More information on filters at the following adresse: <a href="http://community.myddleware.com/index.php/tutorial/#filter-your-data" target="_blank">see the page on filters</a>
        validate: >
                The last stage, if the target application of your rule allows it, you can choose a de-duplication key. To be used in de-duplication, a field must be selected in the tab "field"of the rule. 
                For example, for a CRM application, you can de-duplicate all the contacts by their mail. Myddleware will check if the recording already exist in your target solution, before creating it. If it does not existe, Myddleware will create it.Otherwise it will just update it.
                For more information or personalised assistance, feel free to contact us.
