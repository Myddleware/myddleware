    <h2>Condition Field</h2>
    <p> The condition field is automatically generated with the string {status} == ", and the opening 
    parenthesis as well as the ternary operator  ?"1":"0") will be added automatically.
    <br>
    <br>
    In short, all you need is to write the status name and we do the rest !
    </p>
